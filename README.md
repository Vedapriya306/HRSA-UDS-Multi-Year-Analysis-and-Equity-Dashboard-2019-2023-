Community-University Health Care Center (CUHCC) | May 2024 â€“ Dec 2024
ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project focused on evaluating health equity and access to care at CUHCC, a federally qualified health center serving underserved populations in Minneapolis.

Assess disparities in healthcare access across race, age, insurance, and income levels.
Evaluate service utilization and patient engagement patterns across multiple CUHCC clinics.
